% This script is run to complete the DEBT CHARGE ENGINE step of the model,
% by merging the training set results produced in separate blocks into a
% single file for optimization analysis in the PRODUCE EFFICIENT FRONTIER
% step.


%% 1. Merge results from each training set block into a single training set file
%%
% Each block contains the structures _s_ (parameters of that block's
% training set) and _m_ (results of that block's training set). The purpose
% is to combine the information in each field of _m_ across blocks into a single
% field in the final training set's _m_ structures. (_s_ is taken directly
% since it is the same for all blocks.)

% This subroutine loads the main settings for the debt charge
% engine. The majority of inputs that are updated between model runs, including several user-specific policy inputs, are defined here.


%% Policy Inputs
% These variables are defined via internal policy decision and are set to --- here as a placeholder:
%
    % * _s.issueFeedback_ (see Part 2) : whether to include penalty
    % functions, i.e. additional cost for issuance amounts outside of
    % allowable range ('yes' or 'no')
    % * _s.value_ (see Part 3): steady-state debt stock (above 0) 
    % * _s.initialGDP_ (see Part 3): initial GDP (above 0) 
    % * _s.frExpensesCoef_ (see Part 3) : coefficients on macro variables in expenses growth equation (see Robbins, Torgunrud, and Matier (2007) for details) 
    % * _s.frRevenuesCoef_ (see Part 3) : coefficients on macro variables in revenues growth equation (see Robbins, Torgunrud, and Matier (2007) for details)
    % * _s.frInitRevenues_ (see Part 3) : initial revenues in steady-state (above 0)
